We are in the era of automation. When we think of automation the first thing that comes to the mind is the Automated
(Driverless) Cars.
One of the most basic requirement of a Driverless car is the recognition of traffic signals so that the vehicle can
respond accordingly.
Self driving cars need to make decisions based on what they see.

In this project we use the famous LeNet Deep Network to classify the Traffic Signs.
